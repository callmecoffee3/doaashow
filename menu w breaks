Here is the Python code snippet with breaks added for better readability:
```
print("Top Menu Bar:")
print("Home | Explore | Create | Notifications | Profile | Settings | Games")

print()  # Break

print("Menu Bar:")
print("File | Edit | View | Help | Channel: MetaHub")

print()  # Break

print("Indicator Bar:")
print("Wallet: 100 coins | Follower Feed: 10 | Post Indicator: 4 | Friend Indicator: 3 | Message Indicator: 2 | Notification Indicator (Lite): 5")

print()  # Break

print("JohnDoe â€¢ JohnDoe (Feed: 99+)")
print("Current Time: Saturday, May 11, 2024, 10:45:01 a.m. EDT")
print("Story: 'The Adventure Begins'")
print("Welcome, JohnDoe (Feed: 99+)")

print()  # Break

print("Please select an option by typing the corresponding number.")
print("1. On the Burner - Latest updates and news - Check here for new content!")
print("2. Create - Write a new post or create content - Share your thoughts and ideas!")
print("3. Discover - Explore latest posts and content - Find something new and interesting!")
print("4. DoaShow - Develop a new TV show concept - Share your ideas with industry professionals!")
print("5. Notifications - Check your notifications - See what's new!")
print("6. Profile - View your profile - Edit your information!")
print("7. Settings - Configure your settings - Customize your experience!")
print("8. Help - Display help and instructions - Get assistance when needed!")
print("9. Games - Play games and have fun! (New)")

print()  # Break

print("Type 'menu' to return to the main menu at any time.")
print("Shortcuts:")
print("- 'back' to Go back to the previous menu")
print("- 'exit' to Quit the program")
print("- 'help' to Display help and instructions")
```
This code uses the `print()` function to output each section of the menu, with blank lines (`print()`) added to create breaks between sections for better readability.
