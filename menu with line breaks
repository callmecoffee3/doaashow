Here is the Python code with added line breaks (`\n`) to display the menu:

```
import datetime

print("Top Menu Bar:\n")
print("Home | Explore | Create | Notifications | Profile | Settings | Games\n")

print("Menu Bar:\n")
print("File | Edit | View | Help | Channel: MetaHub\n")

print("Indicator Bar:\n")
print("Wallet: 100 coins | Follower Feed: 10 | Post Indicator: 4 | Friend Indicator: 3 | Message Indicator: 2 | Notification Indicator (Lite): 5\n")

print("[ Profile Picture: A photo of JohnDoe ]\n")
print("JohnDoe â€¢ JohnDoe (Feed: 99+)\n")
print("Profile:\n")
print("Name: John Doe\n")
print("Date of Birth: February 12, 1990\n")
print("Location: New York, USA\n")
print("Bio: Hi, I'm John Doe! I'm a content creator and a TV show enthusiast. I love sharing my thoughts and ideas with the community.\n")

print("Current Time: ", datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%A, %B %d, %Y, %I:%M:%S %p %Z"), "\n")
print("Story: 'The Adventure Begins'\n")

print("Welcome, JohnDoe (Feed: 99+)\n")
print("Please select an option by typing the corresponding number:\n")
print("1. On the Burner - Latest updates and news - Check here for new content!\n")
print("2. Create - Write a new post or create content - Share your thoughts and ideas!\n")
print("3. Discover - Explore latest posts and content - Find something new and interesting!\n")
print("4. DoaShow - Develop a new TV show concept - Share your ideas with industry professionals!\n")
print("5. Notifications - Check your notifications - See what's new!\n")
print("6. Profile - View your profile - Edit your information!\n")
print("7. Settings - Configure your settings - Customize your experience!\n")
print("8. Help - Display help and instructions - Get assistance when needed!\n")
print("9. Games - Play games and have fun! (New)\n")
print("10. Print out main menu - Display the main menu again\n")

print("Type 'menu' to return to the main menu at any time.\n")
print("Shortcuts:\n")
print("- 'back' to Go back to the previous menu\n")
print("- 'exit' to Quit the program\n")
print("- 'help' to Display help and instructions\n")
print("- 'print out main menu' to Display the main menu again\n")
```

This code will print out the menu with line breaks for better readability. The `\n` characters are used to indicate line breaks.
