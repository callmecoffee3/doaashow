Here is a Python code snippet that prints the widget you described:

print("Top Menu Bar:")
print("Home | Explore | Create | Notifications | Profile | Settings | Games")
print("Menu Bar:")
print("File | Edit | View | Help | Channel: MetaHub")
print("Indicator Bar:")
print("Wallet: 100 coins | Follower Feed: 10 | Post Indicator: 4 | Friend Indicator: 3 | Message Indicator: 2 | Notification Indicator (Lite): 5")
print("JohnDoe â€¢ JohnDoe (Feed: 99+)")
print("Current Time: Saturday, May 11, 2024, 10:45:01 a.m. EDT")
print("Story: 'The Adventure Begins'")
print("Welcome, JohnDoe (Feed: 99+)")
print("Please select an option by typing the corresponding number.")
print("1. On the Burner - Latest updates and news - Check here for new content!")
print("2. Create - Write a new post or create content - Share your thoughts and ideas!")
print("3. Discover - Explore latest posts and content - Find something new and interesting!")
print("4. DoaShow - Develop a new TV show concept - Share your ideas with industry professionals!")
print("5. Notifications - Check your notifications - See what's new!")
print("6. Profile - View your profile - Edit your information!")
print("7. Settings - Configure your settings - Customize your experience!")
print("8. Help - Display help and instructions - Get assistance when needed!")
print("9. Games - Play games and have fun! (New)")
print("Type 'menu' to return to the main menu at any time.")
print("Shortcuts: - 'back' to Go back to the previous menu - 'exit' to Quit the program - 'help' to Display help and instructions")


This code uses the print() function to output each line of the widget. You can save this code to a file with a .py extension and run it using Python to see the output.

Note that this code only prints the widget and does not include any interactive functionality. If you want to create a fully functional widget with interactive elements, you would need to use a GUI framework like Tkinter or PyQt, or a web framework like Flask or Django.
