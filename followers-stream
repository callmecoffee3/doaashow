Here is an example of how you might implement a followers' stream in Python:
# Define a simple database of users and their posts
database = {
	'JohnDoe': [
		{'content': 'Hello, world!', 'likes': 10, 'comments': 5, 'shares': 2},
		{'content': 'This is my second post.', 'likes': 5, 'comments': 2, 'shares': 1}
	],
	'JaneSmith': [
		{'content': 'Check out my new video!', 'likes': 20, 'comments': 10, 'shares': 5}
	],
	'BobJohnson': [
		{'content': 'I just posted a new photo!', 'likes': 15, 'comments': 8, 'shares': 3}
	]
}

# Define a simple user class
class User:
	def __init__(self, username):
		self.username = username
		self.following = []

	def follow(self, username):
		self.following.append(username)

	def get_followers_stream(self):
		followers_stream = []
		for followed_user in self.following:
			followers_stream.extend(database[followed_user])
		return followers_stream

# Create a user and have them follow some other users
current_user = User('Alice')
current_user.follow('JohnDoe')
current_user.follow('JaneSmith')

# Get the followers' stream
followers_stream = current_user.get_followers_stream()

# Print the followers' stream
for post in followers_stream:
	print(post)

This code defines a simple database of users and their posts, a simple user class, and then creates a user and has them follow some other users. Finally, it gets the followers' stream and prints it.

Note: This is a very basic example and doesn't include any error handling or security measures that you would need in a real-world application.
