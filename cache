Here is an example of how you can display the cache in Python code:
cache = {
    "username": "JaneDoe",
    "feed": 99,
    "wallet": 100,
    "follower_feed": 10,
    "post_indicator": 4,
    "friend_indicator": 3,
    "message_indicator": 2,
    "notification_indicator": 5
}

print("Cache:")
for key, value in cache.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

This code creates a dictionary called cache that stores various values, such as the username, feed, wallet, and indicators. Then, it uses a for loop to iterate over the items in the cache dictionary and print each key-value pair.

When you run this code, it will output:
Cache:
username: JaneDoe
feed: 99
wallet: 100
follower_feed: 10
post_indicator: 4
friend_indicator: 3
message_indicator: 2
notification_indicator: 5
