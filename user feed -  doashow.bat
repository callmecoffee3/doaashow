Here is an example of how you can create a simple user feed in a batch script:

@echo off

:: User Feed
set /p username=Enter your username: 

:: Display user feed
echo.
echo %username%'s Feed:
echo.
echo Post 1: Hello, world!
echo Post 2: This is my second post.
echo Post 3: I'm loving this feed thing!
echo.

:: Allow user to create new post
set /p newpost=Enter your new post: 
echo.
echo You posted: %newpost%
echo.

:: Display updated user feed
echo %username%'s Feed:
echo.
echo Post 1: Hello, world!
echo Post 2: This is my second post.
echo Post 3: I'm loving this feed thing!
echo Post 4: %newpost%
