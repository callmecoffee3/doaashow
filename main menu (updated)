Here is a simple representation of the menu system in Python:
print("JaneDoe â€¢ JaneDoe (Feed: 99+)")
print("Current Time: Saturday, May 11, 2024, 10:45:01 a.m. EDT")
print("Story: 'The Adventure Begins'")

print("\nTop Menu Bar:")
print("Home | Explore | Create | Notifications | Profile | Settings | Games | User Activity Tracker | Data Cache")

print("\nMenu Bar:")
print("File | Edit | View | Help | Channel: MetaHub | User Activity Tracker")

print("\nIndicator Bar:")
print("Wallet: 100 coins | Follower Feed: 10 | Post Indicator: 4 | Friend Indicator: 3 | Message Indicator: 2 | Notification Indicator (Lite): 5 | User Activity Tracker: 40 minutes (Today: 20 minutes, Yesterday: 10 minutes, This Week: 1 hour 15 minutes) | TheMattGrossoShow TMGS blockchain")

print("\nFriends Bar:")
print("JohnDoe (Online) | JaneSmith (Offline) | BobJohnson (Online)")

print("\nShortcut Bar:")
print("back | exit | help | menu | cache | cookies | memory | history | createdcache | activitycache | useractivity | datacache |")

print("\nPlease select an option by typing the corresponding number:")
print("1. On the Burner - Latest updates and news - Check here for new content!")
print("2. Create - Write a new post or create content - Share your thoughts and ideas!")
print("3. Discover - Explore latest posts and content - Find something new and interesting!")
print("4. DoaShow - Develop a new TV show concept - Share your ideas with industry professionals!")
print("5. Notifications - Check your notifications - See what's new!")
print("6. Profile - View your profile - Edit your information!")
print("7. Settings - Configure your settings - Customize your experience!")
print("8. Help - Display help and instructions - Get assistance when needed!")
print("9. Games - Play games and have fun! (New)")
print("10. Print out main menu - Display the main menu again")

# Get user input
user_input = input("What would you like to do? (type a number or 'menu'): ")

Note: This is a very basic representation and doesn't include any functionality or error handling. In a real-world application, you would want to add more functionality and error handling to make the menu system more robust.
