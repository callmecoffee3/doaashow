Here is an example of how the basic notifications for Doashow.apk could be represented in Python code using a dictionary:
notifications = {
"updates": {
"enabled": True,
"alert": "New update available!",
"sound": "default_sound"
},
"messages": {
"enabled": True,
"alert": "New message from {username}!",
"sound": "message_sound"
},
"mentions": {
"enabled": True,
"alert": "{username} mentioned you in a post!",
"sound": "mention_sound"
},
"likes": {
"enabled": False,
"alert": "{username} liked your post!",
"sound": "like_sound"
}
}

This dictionary stores the basic notifications as key-value pairs, with each notification type (updates, messages, mentions, likes) having its own dictionary with the following keys:

- enabled (boolean): Whether the notification is enabled or disabled
- alert (string): The text to display in the notification
- sound (string): The sound to play when the notification is triggered

Note that the {username} placeholder in the alert strings would be replaced with the actual username of the person who triggered the notification.
