Here is a batch script that creates folders named from "%(+)%a" to "%(+)%z" and "%(+)%0" to "%(+)%9":
@echo off

:: Create folders with letters
for %%i in (a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z) do (
mkdir %(+)%%i
)

:: Create folders with numbers
for %%j in (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) do (
mkdir %(+)%%j
)

This script uses two separate loops to create folders with letters and numbers. You can adjust the ranges or add more characters as needed.

Save this script as a batch file (e.g., create_folders.bat) and run it in the desired directory. It will create 36 folders named from "%(+)%a" to "%(+)%z" and "%(+)%0" to "%(+)%9".

Note: If you want to include more characters, such as symbols or uppercase letters, add them to the respective loop. For example, to include uppercase letters, add (A B C ... Z) to the first loop.
