This script asks the user for a folder name and the number of folders to create. It then creates the specified number of folders, using letters (A-Z) for the first 26 folders and numbers (0-9) for any additional folders.

Note: The for /l loop is used to iterate over the range of folders, and the if statement checks whether to use a letter or number for the folder name. The for /f loop is used to convert the ASCII value to a character (for letters).
