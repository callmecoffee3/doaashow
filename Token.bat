Here is the batch file code to ask the user to set the token details:

```
@echo off

:: Set Token Details

set /p TOKEN_NAME=Enter Token Name: 
set /p TOKEN_SYMBOL=Enter Token Symbol: 
set /p CRYPTO_NAME=Enter Crypto Name: 
set /p DECIMALS=Enter Decimals: 

echo Your Token Details:
echo Token Name: %TOKEN_NAME%
echo Token Symbol: %TOKEN_SYMBOL%
echo Crypto Name: %CRYPTO_NAME%
echo Decimals: %DECIMALS%
A `.bat` file for your cryptocurrency token might contain a set of commands to execute a specific task, such as:

1. *Token generation*: Creating the token and defining its properties.
2. *Smart contract deployment*: Deploying the smart contract to the blockchain.
3. *Token distribution*: Distributing the tokens to participants or wallets.

:: Set token properties
set TOKEN_NAME=TheMattGrossoShow
set TOKEN_SYMBOL=TMGS
set TOKEN_SUPPLY=10000
set TOKEN_DECIMALS=18

:: Deploy smart contract
truffle migrate --network mainnet

:: Generate tokens
node generate_tokens.js %TOKEN_NAME% %TOKEN_SYMBOL% %TOKEN_SUPPLY% %TOKEN_DECIMALS%

:: Distribute tokens
node distribute_tokens.js %TOKEN_NAME% %TOKEN_SYMBOL%
```
This is a simplified example and the actual contents of the `.bat` file will depend on the specific requirements of your token and the tools you're using.

Please note that `.bat` files are specific to Windows and if you're using a different operating system, you might need to use a different type of script file (e.g., `.sh` for Linux/Mac). Additionally, this is a basic example and you should consider security and error handling when creating your own scrip
