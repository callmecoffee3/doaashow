Here is an example of how the basic updates for Doashow.apk could be represented in Python code using a dictionary:
updates = [
{
"type": "post",
"author": "John Doe",
"content": "Hello, world!",
"timestamp": 1672312345
},
{
"type": "comment",
"author": "Jane Smith",
"content": "Great post, John!",
"timestamp": 1672312350,
"parent_id": 1
},
{
"type": "like",
"author": "Bob Johnson",
"content": "",
"timestamp": 1672312355,
"parent_id": 1
}
]

This list of dictionaries represents a feed of updates, where each update is a dictionary with the following keys:

- type (string): The type of update (e.g. post, comment, like)
- author (string): The username of the person who made the update
- content (string): The text content of the update (empty for likes)
- timestamp (integer): The timestamp of the update in seconds since the epoch
- parent_id (integer): The ID of the parent update (for comments and likes)

This is just one way to represent updates in Python code, and the actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements and framework used.

Note: This is a simplified example, in a real-world scenario you would likely have more complex data structures and additional elements to represent the updates, such as user IDs, post IDs, and more.
