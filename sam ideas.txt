Canvas Update in Meta AI
The Canvas update on Meta AI refers to a feature that enhances the user interface and experience on the platform. When the canvas updates, it refreshes the display of conversations, models, or other interactive elements, allowing users to see the latest changes or responses in real-time.
The Canvas update typically involves rendering new content, updating existing content, or adjusting the layout to accommodate new information. This update can be triggered by various actions, such as sending a new message, switching between models, or modifying conversation settings.
