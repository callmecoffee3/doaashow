Here is an example of how you might gather collections (such as posts) from users that the current user is following, using Python:
# Define a simple database of users and their posts
database = {
	'JohnDoe': [
		{'content': 'Hello, world!', 'likes': 10, 'comments': 5, 'shares': 2},
		{'content': 'This is my second post.', 'likes': 5, 'comments': 2, 'shares': 1}
	],
	'JaneSmith': [
		{'content': 'Check out my new video!', 'likes': 20, 'comments': 10, 'shares': 5}
	],
	'BobJohnson': [
		{'content': 'I just posted a new photo!', 'likes': 15, 'comments': 8, 'shares': 3}
	]
}

# Define a simple user class
class User:
	def __init__(self, username):
		self.username = username
		self.following = []

	def follow(self, username):
		self.following.append(username)

	def get_followers_stream(self):
		followers_stream = []
		for followed_user in self.following:
			followers_stream.extend(database[followed_user])
		return followers_stream

# Create a user and have them follow some other users
current_user = User('Alice')
current_user.follow('JohnDoe')
current_user.follow('JaneSmith')

# Get the followers' stream
followers_stream = current_user.get_followers_stream()

# Print the followers' stream
for post in followers_stream:
	print(post)

# Gather collections (such as posts) from users that the current user is following
def gather_collections(username, collection_type):
	collections = []
	for followed_user in database[username].following:
		collections.extend(database[followed_user][collection_type])
	return collections

# Get the posts from the users that the current user is following
posts = gather_collections(current_user.username, 'posts')

# Print the posts
for post in posts:
	print(post)

This code defines a simple database of users and their posts, a simple user class, and then creates a user and has them follow some other users. It then defines a function to gather collections (such as posts) from users that the current user is following, and uses this function to get the posts from the users that the current user is following.

Note: This is a very basic example and doesn't include any error handling or security measures that you would need in a real-world application.
