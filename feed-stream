Here is a simple representation of a feed stream in Python:

print("Feed Stream:")

print("Post 1:")
print("Author: JohnDoe")
print("Content: Hello, world!")
print("Likes: 10")
print("Comments: 5")
print("Shares: 2")
print("")

print("Post 2:")
print("Author: JaneSmith")
print("Content: This is my second post.")
print("Likes: 5")
print("Comments: 2")
print("Shares: 1")
print("")

print("Post 3:")
print("Author: BobJohnson")
print("Content: Check out my new video!")
print("Likes: 20")
print("Comments: 10")
print("Shares: 5")
print("")

Get user input
user_input = input("What would you like to do? (type 'like', 'comment', or 'share'): ")

Note: This is a very basic representation and doesn't include any functionality or error handling. In a real-world application, you would want to add more functionality and error handling to make the feed stream more robust.

Also, in a real-world application, the feed stream would likely be generated dynamically from a database or API, rather than being hardcoded as in this example.
